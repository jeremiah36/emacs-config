CLIENT is automatically generated; EDITOR=CLIENT instructs
COMMAND to use to the current Emacs instance as \"the editor\",

CLIENT may be the path to an appropriate emacsclient executable

mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable the mode
if ARG is a negative number.

evaluate `(default-value \\='shell-command-with-editor-mode)'.

(autoload 'llama "llama" "\
Expand to a `lambda' expression that wraps around FN and BODY.

This macro provides a compact way to write short `lambda' expressions.
It expands to a `lambda' expression, which calls the function FN with
arguments BODY and returns its value.  The arguments of the `lambda'
expression are derived from symbols found in BODY.

Each symbol from `%1' through `%9', which appears in an unquoted part
of BODY, specifies a mandatory argument.  Each symbol from `&1' through
`&9', which appears in an unquoted part of BODY, specifies an optional
argument.  The symbol `&*' specifies extra (`&rest') arguments.

The shorter symbol `%' can be used instead of `%1', but using both in
the same expression is not allowed.  Likewise `&' can be used instead
of `&1'.  These shorthands are not recognized in function position.

To support binding forms that use a vector as VARLIST (such as `-let'
from the `dash' package), argument symbols are also detected inside of
vectors.

The space between `##' and FN can be omitted because `##' is read-syntax
for the symbol whose name is the empty string.  If you prefer you can
place a space there anyway, and if you prefer to not use this somewhat
magical symbol at all, you can instead use the alternative name `llama'.

Instead of:

  (lambda (a &optional _ c &rest d)
    (foo a (bar c) d))

you can use this macro and write:

  (##foo %1 (bar &3) &*)

which expands to:

  (lambda (%1 &optional _&2 &3 &rest &*)
    (foo %1 (bar &3) &*))

Unused trailing arguments and mandatory unused arguments at the border
between mandatory and optional arguments are also supported:

  (##list %1 _%3 &5 _&6)

becomes:

  (lambda (%1 _%2 _%3 &optional _&4 &5 _&6)
    (list %1 &5))

Note how `_%3' and `_&6' are removed from the body, because their names
begin with an underscore.  Also note that `_&4' is optional, unlike the
explicitly specified `_%3'.

Consider enabling `llama-fontify-mode' to highlight `##' and its
special arguments.

Which set of key bindings to add to the global keymap, if any.

This option controls which set of Magit key bindings, if any, may
be added to the global keymap, even before Magit is first used in
the current Emacs session.

If the value is nil, no bindings are added.

If \\+`default', maybe add:

    \\`C-x' \\`g'     `magit-status'
    \\`C-x' \\`M-g'   `magit-dispatch'
    \\`C-c' \\`M-g'   `magit-file-dispatch'

    \\`C-c' \\`g'     `magit-dispatch'
    \\`C-c' \\`f'     `magit-file-dispatch'

    These bindings are strongly recommended, but we cannot use
    them by default, because the \\`C-c <LETTER>' namespace is
    strictly reserved for bindings added by the user.

The bindings in the chosen set may be added when
`after-init-hook' is run.  Each binding is added if, and only
if, at that time no other key is bound to the same command,
and no other command is bound to the same key.  In other words
we try to avoid adding bindings that are unnecessary, as well
as bindings that conflict with other bindings.

Adding these bindings is delayed until `after-init-hook' is
run to allow users to set the variable anywhere in their init
file (without having to make sure to do so before `magit' is
loaded or autoloaded) and to increase the likelihood that all
the potentially conflicting user bindings have already been
added.

To set this variable use either `setq' or the Custom interface.
Do not use the function `customize-set-variable' because doing
that would cause Magit to be loaded immediately, when that form
is evaluated (this differs from `custom-set-variables', which
doesn't load the libraries that define the customized variables).

Toggle VC diff highlighting.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the `Diff-Hl
mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable the mode, and if
it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable the
mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable the mode
if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate the variable `diff-hl-mode'.

disabled.

The default value chosen using one of methods below:

- In a log view buffer, it uses the revision of current entry.
Call `vc-print-log' or `vc-print-root-log' first to open a log
view buffer.
- In a VC annotate buffer, it uses the revision of current line.
- In other situations, it uses the symbol at point.

Notice that this sets the reference revision globally, so in
files from other repositories, `diff-hl-mode' will not highlight
changes correctly, until you run `diff-hl-reset-reference-rev'.

Also notice that this will disable `diff-hl-amend-mode' in
buffers that enables it, since `diff-hl-amend-mode' overrides its
